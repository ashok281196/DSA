# DSA Roadmap

## How to use this roadmap
- Treat the phases as themed sprints; spend the suggested time but move on once you can explain the idea and solve the highlighted problems without help.
- For each topic, learn the core theory, code the patterns from scratch, then drill the LeetCode set. Revisit missed problems after 24 hours and one week.
- Track progress in a spreadsheet or checklist so revision cycles remain intentional.
