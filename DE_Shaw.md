2- Why we use static in Java

3-How HashMap are Implemented

*   Second, question was to code Map data structure and it's function, followed by a set of questions:
    

1.  How is this data structure able to take multiple data types in input, ex: map, map.¬†**Ans**: It will be class structure using generics in Java
    
2.  Write the methods it should perform, like get, put, remove etc.
    
3.  What happens if the key is already present, what is this phenomena called?¬†**Ans**: Collision and explained about collision handling.
    
4.  How will you make these methods thread safe?
    
5.  What are the variious issues when using multithreading?
    
6.  What is race-condition?
